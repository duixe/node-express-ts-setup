# NodeJS back-end set up with TypeScript

This repo illustrate my preferable way of setting up Nodejs (Express and MongoDB) back-end develeopment with typescript.


## Appendix

This project can be used as a starter template or framework for building a back-end application with either the MEAN, MERN or the MEVN stack

NB: for more clarification I've added README files to each directory in the "src" directory.
