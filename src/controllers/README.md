# Controllers

**This directory is required ðŸ¤¨, Since this project is based on an MVC architecture**

The controller contains both the routes - which can be found in the setRoutes() method, and the controllers (private methods) themselves.

Depending on the size of the project one can add multiple controller files or even group them into seperate directories.
